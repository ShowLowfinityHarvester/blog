        <p>On January 29, 2025, a tragic mid-air collision occurred near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C., involving an American Eagle regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter. Unfortunately, all 67 individuals on board both aircraft did not survive. This is the first major commercial air accident in the United States since the Colgan Air (Continental Connection) crash in 2009. This is the first fatal accident involving a Bombardier CRJ700, and so far, this has been the worst air disaster of 2025. This is the first fatal air disaster for american airlines since flight 587 in November 2001.</p>

        <h3>More Details</h3>
        <p>The first aircraft involved in the incident was American Eagle flight 5342, a 20 year old Bombardier CRJ700, registered N709PS, operated by PSA which was en route to D.C from Wichita, KS. The aircraft carried 60 passengers and 4 crew members, making a total of 64 people on board the aircraft. The second aircraft involved was a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, with callsign PAT25. It was operated by the U.S army for a training mission and 3 people were on board.</p>

       <h3>Sequence of events</h3>
       <p>At approximately 8:47 PM EST on January 29th 2025, PSA airlines flight 5342 was on final approach to runway 33 at Reagan National Airport, when an air traffic controller instructed the military helicopter to report pass behind the jet. Moments later, the two aircraft collided over the Potomac River, which caused both of them to crash into the freezing river. Emergency crew were immediately dispatched to the scene. The collision was captured on camera, showing the military helicopter crossing directly in front of the CRJ before the two aircraft collided midair. The CRJ seemed to fall into the river in a nose down position, however, that has not yet been officially confirmed yet.</p><hr>

    <h3>Recovery effects and responses</h3>
    <p>Rescue teams, including fireboats and divers, were dispatched to the crash site. Cold temperatures and icy weather conditions hampered recovery operations. As of this update, it is said that unfortunately, no one survived the crash. Among the victims, were figure skaters and their families, coaches, and former world champions. They were all returning from a development camp in Wichita. President Trump held a press conference yesterday, blaming the crash on DEI programs without providing any evidence. His remarks were met with widespread criticism from aviation experts and the general public, who argue that DEI initiatives expand the pool of qualified candidates without lowering safety standards. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom has stated that he will cooperate fully with the NTSB's investigation and emphasizes the companies commitment to supporting the families and victims involved in the incident.  As investigators work to determine the cause of this tragic collision, our thoughts from all of us here at the WSLF Radio Media Group go out to the families and loved ones of those lost in this tragedy. We will continue to provide updates as new information emerges.</p>
